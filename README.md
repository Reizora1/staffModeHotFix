# StaffMode Spigot Plugin Hotfix
- This plugin hotfix is for: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/⭐-staffmode-⭐.110187/
- Fixes the following issue/s:
- - When the server closes/crash while a staff is in staffmode and rejoins the server after restart, they retain creative mode. They are able to grab items/place/break blocks despite already doing /staffmode by disabling it.
- - Items of the said staff before going into staffmode will be lost forever.
